This is an example project created by Mark and Kellie Johnson to present at a [Humboldt Makers](http://www.humboldtmakers.org/) meeting.

It consists of two parts:

* arduino - code for an Arduino Uno R3 connected to a DS18B20 temperature sensor brick, an Ethernet Shield, and a 20x4 LCD
* web - code to show a Javascript-based web browser graph of temperature data
